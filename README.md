     + Data pre-processing
     + Algorithms tried: kNN, Logistic regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
     + Choosing the best performance metric from each type of ML classifier and comparing it to the best performing one of the others
     + Ranking of best to the worst ML algorithm
     + Relevant literature evidence
